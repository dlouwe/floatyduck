*An experiment in Improv Coding*


The Rules of Improv Coding
---
1. A pull request should add as close to a single statement as possible
2. A pull request should keep code runnable
3. One pull request shall be accepted from one contributor at a time (round-robin)
  * But a contributer can submit as many consecutive pull requests at a time as they like. It's up to the gatekeeper to round-robin the merges.
4. All pull requests shall be accepted without question
5. The rules don't apply to the README
6. **All rules are meant to be broken in the name of awesome**
